# steam-reviews-browser

A very simple tool for downloading all reviews for a Steam App ID. The main motivation for creating this tool came from the frustration of the terrible UI of the Steam reviews browser. When doing research I read a lot of reviews, and I want to be able to read them in a simple way, without any clicking in and out of reviews. This tool downloads all reviews and renders them in plain text. It's ugly, but it works.
